# Basketball for Space Documentation

### 1. Generate your Dribbble Token
You need this token so Basketball can request your shots and profile data from Dribbble. Getting this token is not so straight forward, so I made auth.usebasketball.com. It's easy to use, so just follow the steps and return to this page when you're done.

### 2. Deploy Basketball on Deta Space

Now deploy Basketball on Deta Space. Then, click on the tree dots on your apps icon. This will open the config menu.

In here, enter the token you've generated in Step 1. Then, click on the "Save Changes" button.

Now, when you visit your instance, it should show your Dribbble profile.
